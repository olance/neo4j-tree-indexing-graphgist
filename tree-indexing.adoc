= In-graph tree indexing

Storing tree structures in a graph database makes a lot of sense. However, some trees are easier to play with than others.
Some constraints will make things much more complicated. Ordered children for instance, or time-dependent hierarchies (a tree 
that changes in time), or ordered time-dependent hierarchies...

In this GraphGist, I will present an indexing structure that makes it easier to deal with that kind of trees and that allows:

* Returning the full hierarchy with a single query, in a depth-first traversal fashion that allows building back the 
hierarchy in memory using your client language.
* Similarly, extracting the full subtree from a given node, with a single query.
* List direct children of any given node within the tree.

All of this while maintaining children order in the returned data!

_NB:_ As you will see this technique trades storage space for query efficiency, so it may not be appropriate for large
amounts of data.
